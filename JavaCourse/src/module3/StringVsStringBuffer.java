 * Objective:
 * Demonstrate the difference between String and StringBuffer in Java, focusing on mutability and string manipulation.
 *
 * Description:
 * This program illustrates how String and StringBuffer handle modifications differently.
 * Strings in Java are immutableâ€”any modification creates a new object.
 * In contrast, StringBuffer is mutable, allowing changes to the same object with better performance for repeated modifications.
 *
 * Contents of the Program:
 * - Create and modify a String object using concatenation.
 * - Create and modify a StringBuffer object using append(), insert(), replace(), and reverse() methods.
 * - Print the state of the objects after each operation to observe behavior.
 *
 * How Achieved Using Concepts:
 * - Demonstrated immutability of String by modifying it through reassignment.
 * - Demonstrated mutability of StringBuffer by modifying it in-place using its methods.
 * - Used key StringBuffer methods (append, insert, replace, reverse) to show its flexibility.
 * - Reinforced the concept of memory and performance implications between String and StringBuffer.
